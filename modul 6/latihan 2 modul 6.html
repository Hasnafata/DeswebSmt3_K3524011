  <h2>PTIK FKIP UNS</h2>

  <p id="p1">
    The <span class="target">Faculty of Teacher Training and Education</span>, <span class="target">Sebelas Maret University</span>, 
    Surakarta is an <span class="target">Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK)</span> 
    which has 24 study programs in 6 majors. Each study program has its own characteristics 
    in producing <span class="target">superior, strong and intelligent educational staff</span>.
  </p>

  <p id="p2">
    The <span class="target">Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK)</span> study program 
    is planned to take shelter in the management of the 
    <span class="target">Engineering and Vocational Education (PTK)</span> department.
    This placement revises our previous statement, where the PTIK study program is under the P.MIPA department.
    PTIK is a study program that will produce graduates who are 
    <span class="target">prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational programs</span>.
    So, it would be better if PTIK was under the PTK department which oversees vocational programs such as 
    <span class="target">Building Engineering Education</span>, and 
    <span class="target">Mechanical Engineering Education</span>.
    To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of information technology that cannot be met by the PTK department, 
    PTIK will conduct <span class="target">resource sharing with the mathematics study program</span>.
