    <h2>PTIK FKIP UNS</h2>

    <p id="p1">
        The <span class="target">Faculty of Teacher Training and Education</span>,  <span class="target">Sebelas Maret University</span>, Surakarta
        is an <span class="target">Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK)</span> which has 24 study
        programs in 6 majors. Each study program has its own characteristics in producing
        <span class="target">superior, strong and intelligent educational staff</span>.
    </p>

    <p id="p2">
        The <span class="target">Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK)</span> study program is
        planned to take shelter in the management of the
        <span class="target">Engineering and Vocational Education (PTK)</span> department. This placement revises our
        previous statement, where the PTIK study program is under the P.MIPA department. PTIK is a study program
        that will produce graduates who are <span class="target">prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational programs</span>.
        So, it would be better if PTIK was under the PTK department which oversees vocational programs such as
        <span class="target">Building Engineering Education</span>, and
        <span class="target">Mechanical Engineering Education</span>. To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of
        information technology that cannot be met by the PTK department, PTIK will conduct
        <span class="target">resource sharing with the mathematics study program</span>.
    </p>
